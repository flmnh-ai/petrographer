Description: Automated petrographic analysis of thin section images using
    deep learning models. Provides tools for training Detectron2 models,
    running predictions with SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference),
    calculating morphological properties, and analyzing results. Supports
    both local and HPC training workflows with seamless R-Python
    integration via reticulate.
