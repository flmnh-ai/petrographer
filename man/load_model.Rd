\arguments{
\item{model_path}{Path to trained model weights (ignored if \code{model_name} is supplied or \code{model_path} appears to be a pin name).}

\item{config_path}{Path to model config (ignored if loading from a pin).}

\item{confidence}{Confidence threshold (default: 0.5).}

\item{device}{Device to use: 'cpu', 'cuda', 'mps' (default: 'cpu').}

\item{model_name}{Optional pin name to load from a board.}

\item{version}{Specific version to load when using pins (NULL for latest).}

\item{board}{Optional pins board (defaults to \code{\link[=pg_board]{pg_board()}}).}
}
\value{
A \code{PetrographyModel} object.
}
\description{
Loads a Detectron2/SAHI model either from file paths or by pin name via
the pins registry. When \code{model_name} is supplied (or \code{model_path} does not
exist and does not end with \code{.pth}), the model is retrieved from a board
using \code{\link[=get_model]{get_model()}}.
